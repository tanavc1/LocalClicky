# LocalClicky architecture

LocalClicky keeps the original Clicky's menu‑bar UX and blue‑cursor overlay, and
replaces every cloud call with an on‑device equivalent. The only network traffic
is HTTP to a local Ollama server on `127.0.0.1:11434`.

## Packages / targets

| Target | Kind | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `LocalBrainKit` | library | The no‑UI "brain": Ollama client (installed‑model listing, capability detection, streaming model `pull`), format‑robust `[POINT]` parser, prompts, model config + roles, conversation router, spoken‑text segmenter, browser‑ and app‑command planners, `HardwareAdvisor` + `AutotuneBridge` (hardware‑aware model recommendation), and `WebReachTool` (the opt‑in web lookup). Pure logic, unit‑testable, no AppKit. |
| `CSherpaOnnx` | C target | Thin module exposing the sherpa‑onnx C API (neural TTS) to Swift. Implementations come from the vendored dylib the app links. |
| `LocalClicky` | executable (app) | The menu‑bar SwiftUI/AppKit app: overlay, panel, capture, push‑to‑talk, neural voice, browser executor, `CompanionManager`. |
| `localbrain-harness` | executable (CLI) | Runs the full local pipeline against the real models, headless, for verification. |
| `LocalBrainKitTests` | tests | Pointing‑parser unit tests (XCTest; needs Xcode to run, or use `--selftest`). |

## The answer pipeline

1. **Push‑to‑talk** — a listen‑only `CGEvent` tap detects Control+Option globally
   (`GlobalPushToTalkShortcutMonitor`), unchanged from the original.
2. **Speech‑to‑text** — `BuddyDictationManager` captures mic audio via
   `AVAudioEngine` and streams it to `AppleSpeechTranscriptionProvider`, which uses
   `SFSpeechRecognizer` with `requiresOnDeviceRecognition = true`. No cloud STT.
3. **Screenshot** — on release, `CompanionScreenCaptureUtility` captures the cursor
   screen with ScreenCaptureKit (≤1152 px JPEG), excluding LocalClicky's own
   windows. The screenshot's pixel size defines the model's coordinate space.
4. **Routing** — `ConversationRouter` decides per turn whether this is a
   deterministic **action** (copy the last answer / launch an app / a browser
   command), needs the **screen**, or is a self‑contained/follow‑up **text**
   question. This is what makes follow‑ups work: "what's 3×5" → "15", then "add 2 to
   that" routes to the text model with history (no screenshot) and answers "17",
   instead of the screenshot hijacking the answer. It's a fast heuristic — no extra
   model call — so it also saves latency by skipping the VLM when the screen isn't
   needed. Action turns skip inference entirely (see [Actions](#actions)).
   The router has five non‑action question routes: **`.screen`** (describe what's
   on screen), **`.screenPoint`** (point at a UI element — "where do I click"),
   **`.text`** (self‑contained / follow‑up), **`.showText`** ("give me X in text"
   → a concise answer in the blue side‑text), and **`.webReach`** (the opt‑in
   internet lookup). A "where do I click to open settings" question is detected as
   pointing *first*, so the app/browser launcher never hijacks it.
5. **Inference** — `CompanionManager` builds an Ollama chat request per route:
   - **`.screen`** (describe): screenshot + the `screenDescribe` prompt, sent to the
     **vision model** (default `moondream` — strong at description, doesn't ground).
   - **`.screenPoint`** (point): screenshot + the directive `screenPointResponse`
     prompt, sent to the **grounding model** (default `qwen2.5vl:3b`), which returns
     a `[POINT:x,y]` ~9/10 of the time (measured; up from ~1/2).
   - **`.text` / `.showText` / `.webReach`**: no image, sent to the **text model**
     (default `llama3.2:3b`).
   `OllamaClient.streamChat` streams the reply and reports first‑token latency and
   decode tok/s. Each **model** gets a consistent, **per‑role** `num_ctx` — a snug
   4096 for the text model, a roomy 8192 for vision/grounding (a screenshot +
   history is token‑heavy). Because text and vision are different models, this never
   triggers a reload; when one VLM fills both roles it gets the roomy window in
   both (`CompanionManager.contextWindow(forModel:)`). The smaller text KV cache is
   what lets the `HardwareAdvisor` keep **two models resident** on 16 GB.
6. **Pointing** — `PointingTagParser` pulls the pointing tag out of the reply. It
   accepts the classic `[POINT:x,y:label]`, qwen2.5‑vl's attribute form
   `[POINT x="x" y="y"]`, and a bare `[x1,y1,x2,y2:label]` box (collapsed to its
   center). The remaining text is what gets spoken.
7. **Cursor** — the image‑pixel point is mapped to a global AppKit coordinate on
   the captured display (`CompanionManager.globalScreenLocation(forImagePoint:in:)`)
   and published as `detectedElementScreenLocation` /
   `detectedElementDisplayFrame`. `BlueCursorView` observes those and flies the blue
   triangle along a bezier arc to the element — the original overlay, untouched.
8. **Voice** — the answer is spoken **as it streams**: `SpokenTextSegmenter` peels
   off complete sentences (never the `[POINT]` tag) so the companion starts talking
   after the first sentence instead of waiting for the whole answer.
   `SpeechSynthesisCoordinator` prefers the neural Piper voice and falls back to
   Apple's synthesizer.

For an **action** (step 4), the turn skips inference entirely and is resolved by
deterministic rules — see [Actions](#actions).

## Choosing your models

The defaults (`llama3.2:3b` text, `qwen2.5vl:3b` vision) are tuned for a 16 GB Mac,
but each role can be pointed at any installed Ollama model from the panel's
**Models** picker (persisted by `ModelPreferences`). The picker is hardware‑aware
and safe:

- `OllamaClient.listInstalledModels()` enumerates `/api/tags`; `capabilities(of:)`
  reads `/api/show`. The **vision** menu lists only models whose capabilities
  include `vision`; the **text** menu lists only models with `completion` (so an
  embedding‑only model can't be chosen). A text‑only model can never be wired to the
  screen role.
- Changing a model re‑warms it (`warmUpLocalModels`) and re‑checks install status.
  `OllamaClient.modelInstalled(_:among:)` normalizes tags (`llama3.2` ≡
  `llama3.2:latest`) so the "models missing" nudge is accurate.
- More RAM → pick `qwen3-vl:8b` for sharper grounding; less → a smaller text model.
  `swift run localbrain-harness --models` prints what's installed and each model's
  eligible role(s).

## Actions

Three kinds of spoken command are handled **deterministically** (no pixel‑clicking,
no model JSON), each structurally incapable of anything destructive:

- **Browser** — `BrowserCommandPlanner` (pure, in `LocalBrainKit`) maps "open a new
  tab, go to my gmail, and open up a draft" to concrete URLs via a known‑site table
  (a draft → Gmail's real compose URL); `BrowserActionExecutor` opens them with
  `NSWorkspace.open`. The only thing it can do is navigate to a URL — it cannot
  click, submit, send, or run page scripts.
- **App launch** — `AppCommandPlanner` extracts the app name from "launch spotify" /
  "open the notes app" (pure + unit‑tested); `LocalAppLauncher` resolves it to an
  app that's actually installed (Launch Services by name, which even finds system
  apps like Safari behind the read‑only firmlink, plus a fuzzy scan of the
  Applications folders) and opens it — as safe as double‑clicking in Finder. If no
  app matches, it falls back to a web search for the same words, then to saying it
  couldn't find it. Matching is conservative on purpose (e.g. "photoshop" never
  resolves to "Photos").
- **Clipboard** — "copy your answer" / "copy that to my clipboard" writes the
  companion's last real spoken answer to `NSPasteboard`. Useful right after asking
  it to write, translate, or summarize something.

## Why a local VLM for coordinates (and not just a small model guessing pixels)

Small VLMs are unreliable at free‑form pixel grounding on dense UIs — the upstream
PR's `TAKEOVER.md` documents exactly this failure mode. `qwen2.5vl:3b` turned out
to be a sweet spot: it returns accurate **bounding boxes** for named UI elements,
and the parser collapses those to a center point. On a synthetic UI it grounded
targets to within ~15–20 px at sub‑second warm latency. The parser is intentionally
tolerant (accepts `[POINT:x,y]`, `[POINT:x1,y1,x2,y2]`, and bare boxes) so changing
the model later doesn't break pointing.

> Headroom: because pointing is just "name an element → resolve to a screen
> coordinate," a future version can snap the VLM's box to the nearest
> Vision‑framework OCR word box or Accessibility element for pixel‑perfect targets,
> fully locally. The architecture already isolates this in `PointingTagParser` +
> the coordinate mapping.

## Voice (neural, on‑device)

The robotic option (Apple's compact `AVSpeechSynthesizer` voices) is the fallback,
not the default. The default is a **Piper** neural voice (`en_US-ryan-medium`) run
through the **sherpa‑onnx** runtime, linked **in‑process** via its C API
(`CSherpaOnnx` + `PiperSpeechSynthesisClient`). In‑process matters: shelling out to
a TTS binary reloads the ~60 MB model every call (~3 s); holding it resident makes
synthesis ~0.05–0.1 s per sentence (≈20× real‑time) at a negligible battery cost.
The runtime + voice are vendored in `vendor/sherpa/` (fetch with
`scripts/fetch-tts.sh`) and copied into `LocalClicky.app/Contents/Resources/sherpa/`
by `build-app.sh`. If they're missing, the coordinator silently uses the Apple voice.

## Measured on this dev machine (M2, 16 GB)

Verified with `localbrain-harness` against the real models:

| path | cold (first call) | warm |
|---|---|---|
| text chat (`llama3.2:3b`) | ~4.5 s (model load) | first token ~0.5 s, ~45 tok/s |
| screen vision + pointing (`qwen2.5vl:3b`, 1280 px) | model load once | first token ~0.17 s, full answer ~1.4 s |
| neural TTS (`en_US-ryan-medium`) | ~0.4 s load (once) | ~0.05–0.1 s / sentence |

Latency work (verified before/after):
- **Warm‑up on launch** (`CompanionManager.warmUpLocalModels` + the voice graph)
  turns a ~4.5 s cold first query into ~0.17 s.
- **Sentence‑streaming TTS** starts speech ~0.8 s sooner than waiting for the whole
  answer.
- **Routing** skips the slower VLM for text turns (and skips inference entirely for
  action turns).
- **Consistent `num_ctx`** across text/vision/warm‑up means a model is never
  reloaded for a different context size — important when one model fills both roles.
- Screenshot stays at **≤1152 px**: the harness sweep showed shrinking it gives ~0
  latency benefit (first token already ~0.17 s) while hurting pointing accuracy.

Ollama keeps models warm (`keep_alive`), so the cold load is a one‑time cost per
model per session.

## Public‑release subsystems

- **Hardware advisor + autotune (hybrid).** `HardwareAdvisor` (native, always
  works) detects RAM/cores, holds a curated model catalog with resident‑RAM
  footprints, and recommends the best models per role + which to keep resident.
  `AutotuneBridge` detects the optional [`autotune`](https://autotunellm.com) CLI
  and layers its recommendation on top. Drives the warm‑up set, the per‑role
  `num_ctx`, `keep_alive`, and a non‑invasive blue‑text suggestion when a better
  model fits. See `localbrain-harness --advise`.
- **In‑app model + Ollama setup.** `OllamaClient.pullModel` streams `/api/pull`
  (dedicated long‑timeout session); `OllamaInstaller` detects/downloads Ollama.
  The panel offers a **Download Ollama** button and a fit‑gated **Add a model**
  dropdown → download with progress → warm into RAM.
- **First‑run + blue side‑text.** No onboarding video/music. `companionSideText`
  drives a streamed first‑run intro, a two‑step screen‑aware joke (Moondream
  describes → text model jokes), "give me X in text" answers, and model tips.
- **Web reach (opt‑in, the one cloud exception).** `WebReachTool` does keyless web
  read + search via Jina Reader (`r.jina.ai`); the local text model summarizes.
  Only the `.webReach` route triggers it, and the UI shows "checking the web…".

Pointing accuracy on the synthetic test UI: ~14–20 px error; tag‑return rate ~9/10
(see `docs/benchmarks/`).

## What's verified vs. what needs a human at the GUI

Verified here (headless / build): the local brain end‑to‑end (chat + vision +
pointing coordinates), all parser unit checks, a clean compile of the whole app
(16 files, no warnings, no cloud references), and that `LocalClicky.app` launches
as a registered menu‑bar GUI app and runs without crashing.

Needs you at the Mac (can't be automated): granting the four TCC permissions,
speaking into the mic, and visually confirming the blue cursor flies to the right
spot. The pipeline that produces those coordinates is verified; the on‑screen
animation is the original Clicky overlay driven by the same published properties.
